# Pride! for the tty

A utility to display pride flags in 8- or 256- color terminals.

This is a C version of my [pride](https://git.vwolfe.io/valerie/pride) utility,
focused on compatibility.

## Goals

- Compatible: Runs, compiles, and correctly displays on almost anything.
- Low-dependency: Only uses the standard library.
- Small: Low compiled binary size.
